## **PART III: ERC20-TOKEN MONOREPO DEVELOPMENT**
*Sessions from ~/.claude/projects/erc20-token-project/*

### Major Architectural Transformation
**Git Commit**: *"Restructure project as monorepo with contracts and frontend packages"*

```
New Monorepo Structure:
erc20-token/
├── packages/
│   ├── contracts/     # Hardhat-based smart contracts
│   └── frontend/      # Next.js 14 web application  
├── package.json       # Workspace configuration
└── CLAUDE.md          # Development guide
```

### Advanced Smart Contract Development

#### Revolutionary Airdrop System Implementation
The project's standout innovation: a sophisticated three-tier airdrop campaign system:

**New Core Contracts:**
1. **BatchAirdrop.sol** - Direct batch distribution for small recipient lists (<500)
2. **MerkleAirdrop.sol** - Merkle tree-based airdrops for large lists (>1000)  
3. **PublicAirdrop.sol** - Open claim campaigns with advanced management
4. **ConditionalAirdrop.sol** - Conditional claim functionality

**Campaign Types Developed:**
- **Simple Campaigns**: One-time claims with basic parameters
- **Faucet Campaigns**: Recurring claims with cooldown periods  
- **Conditional Campaigns**: Claims requiring specific conditions (ETH balance, token holdings)

**Campaign Features:**
- Flexible timing constraints (start/end times)
- Budget management with total caps
- User-specific limits (max claims per user)
- Cooldown periods between claims
- Real-time status monitoring and management

### Frontend Development Achievement

#### Next.js 14 Application Development
**Framework**: Modern Next.js 14 with App Router and static export capabilities
**Deployment Target**: GitHub Pages with CDN optimization

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Web3 Integration**: Wagmi + RainbowKit for seamless wallet connections
- **Multi-Network Support**: Automatic network switching between Ethereum/Base
- **Campaign Management Interface**: Real-time campaign status and claiming
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with professionally implemented dark mode
- **Component Architecture**: Modular React components (`CampaignCard.tsx`, wallet components)

## **PART IV: RECENT SESSION DETAILED BREAKDOWN**

# Current Session Activities Summary

## Chronological Breakdown of Tasks & Requests

### Phase 1: Initial Campaign Deployment
**User Request**: `npm run create-public-campaign in packages/contracts directory`

**Issues Encountered**:
- Compilation error: `DeclarationError: Undeclared identifier createConditionalCampaign`
- Fixed by changing `createConditionalCampaign()` to `this.createConditionalCampaign()`
- Missing `PUBLIC_AIRDROP_ADDRESS` environment variable
- Deployed new airdrop contracts and created campaign successfully

**Outcome**: Successfully deployed Base Sepolia faucet campaign

### Phase 2: Frontend UI/UX Improvements
**User Requests**:
1. `"some of the ui font is too dark, it's black on a dark screen. can we fix this"`
2. `"better, although the status card in the campagine card is still in light mode"`
3. `"much better, also change the testnet icon warning to have better contrast too"`
4. `"it still feels poor. it doesn't look like anything changes"`
5. `"better, launch a new facuet public campaign using the existing setup. just run the script"`
6. `"much better, let's just make the app always in dark mode"`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `packages/frontend/src/styles/globals.css` with dark mode CSS variables
- Added force overrides for Tailwind colors
- Modified `packages/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` to force dark mode
- Improved contrast ratios throughout the UI

### Phase 3: Multi-Network Deployment
**User Request**: `"let's also add the same facuet campagin for the eth sepolia network too"`

**Challenges**:
- Gas estimation errors with Coinbase Wallet
- Root cause: Airdrop contract pointing to non-existent token address
- Network congestion and insufficient funds on Sepolia
- 4 pending transactions blocking deployments

**Solutions**:
- Deployed new token contracts with proper ownership
- Created cancellation scripts for stuck transactions
- Successfully deployed to both Base Sepolia and Sepolia networks

### Phase 4: Security & Deployment Setup
**User Requests**:
1. `"if i deploy this as a static website am i exposing any senstive keys?"`
2. `"make a github action that deploys this as a static website to the gh-pages branch"`
3. `"confirm nothing senstive will be commits if i add all files"`

**Security Analysis**:
- Confirmed only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed (safe)
- Private keys and sensitive data properly ignored via `.gitignore`
- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow

**Created Files**:
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Complete deployment workflow
- Updated environment variable handling

### Phase 5: Build System Fixes
**User Request**: `"npm run build in frontend fails with Failed to compile."`

**Error**: `Type error: BigInt literals are not available when targeting lower than ES2020.`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `tsconfig.json`: `"target": "es5"` → `"es2020"`
- Updated library support: `"lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "es6"]` → `"es2020"`
- Simplified ESLint configuration to remove TypeScript plugin dependencies
- Fixed React Hook violations in `usePublicAirdrop.ts`
- Fixed TypeScript type casting for contract operations

### Phase 6: Static Website Validation
**User Request**: `"validate that npm run build creates a valid static website, perhaps lets try open it locally after building"`

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ Build successful with static files in `out/` directory
- ✅ Generated `index.html`, `404.html`, CSS, and JS chunks
- ✅ Local HTTP server test returned 200 status codes
- ✅ All routes marked as static (○ symbol)
- ✅ Proper meta tags and dark mode styling

### Phase 7: GitHub Pages Deployment Fix
**User Request**: `"the github pages deployed version at https://mathuo.github.io/erc20-token/ is not working"`

**Root Cause**: Asset paths not configured for GitHub Pages subpath deployment

**Solution**:
- Added `basePath: '/erc20-token'` and `assetPrefix: '/erc20-token/'` to `next.config.js`
- Used `GITHUB_PAGES` environment variable for conditional activation
- Updated GitHub Actions to set `GITHUB_PAGES=true` during build
- Added missing Sepolia contract addresses to deployment environment

### Phase 8: Version Control & Documentation
**User Requests**:
1. `"nice, let's commit our work ensuring no secrets are exposed"`
2. `"lets commit this"` (after build fixes)

**Commits Made**:
1. **Major Restructure**: `"Restructure project as monorepo with contracts and frontend packages"`
